# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to **predict the risk of heart disease** using machine learning techniques.  
It uses a dataset containing health-related attributes (like age, cholesterol, blood pressure, etc.) to train models, and then deploys the prediction system as an interactive **Streamlit web application**.

The project demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing & cleaning
- Model training and evaluation
- Integration of ML model with a Streamlit app
- End-to-end automation with `run_all.py`

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Libraries & Tools:**
  - Pandas, NumPy (Data handling)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine Learning models)
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (Visualization)
  - Streamlit (Web app)
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
